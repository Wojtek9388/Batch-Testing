# Batch-Testing
Its a Place where I save batch exploits/scripts for use with a flipper zero.

Feel Free to add or fork this even though there are way better exploits than mine

# How to use
.txt Files are Put into the "SD Card/Badusb" (might be different on your flipper depending on hardware im using Unleased 79E currently)
Everything else is downloaded through batch scripts
