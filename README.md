# Flipper Zero Exploits
Its a place where I save Bad USB exploits/scripts for use with a flipper zero.

# Usage
Feel Free to add or fork this even though there are way better exploits than mine

__USE THIS WITH PERMISION OR ON YOUR OWN MACHINE ANY ILLEGAL USE OF THIS IS NOT ON ME AND ENTIRELY YOUR FAULT YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED__

# Notes
All of the files that any of these make have the hidden flag enabled
you can turn that off by removing the "STRING attrib +h [filename]"

# How to use
.txt Files are Put into the "SD Card/Badusb" (might be different on your flipper depending on hardware im using Unleased 79E currently)
Everything else is downloaded through batch scripts
